# DSC540-Association-Rules-Mining
An assignment for DSC540 (Machine Learning for Data Science) at GCU that focused on mining association rules ("if-then"-style relationships between items) from a chosen dataset. See README.md for more information. The goal was to take a dataset containing interactions between a Portuguese bank and its clients and mine it for association rules, which would help the bank understand its clients better and improve its services.

# Assignment Instructions

# Part 1
To perform association rules analysis/mining, complete the following:
1. Access the "UCI Machine Learning Repository," located in the topic Resources. Note: There are about 120 data sets that are suitable for use in a clustering task. For this part of the exercise, you must choose two of these datasets, provided they include at least 10 attributes and 10,000 instances.
2. Ensure that the data sets are suitable for clustering using this method.
3. You may search for data in other repositories, such as Data.gov or Kaggle.

# Part 2
For your selected dataset, build a clustering model as follows:
1. Explain the dataset and the type of information you wish to extract. Recall that the dataset must consist of transactions of the form If {x1, x2, …, xn} then {y1, y2, …, yk}.
2. Explain the Apriori algorithm and how you will be using it in your analysis (list the steps, the intuition behind the mathematical representation, and address its assumptions).
3. Identify the appropriate software packages.
4. Preprocess the data, describe their characteristics, and visualize key characteristics like popular items and choices.
5. Build the clustering model by implementing the Apriori algorithm.
6. Run the model (make predictions).
7. Display clustering results (quantitative and visual).
8. Explain the meaning of each step in the context of the dataset.
9. Interpret results and adjust your clustering.
10. Validate the model, addressing support, confidence, lift, and conviction. Then, explain the results.

Prepare a comprehensive technical report as a markdown document or Jupyter notebook, including all code, code comments, all outputs, plots, and analysis. Make sure the project documentation contains a) problem statement, b) algorithm of the solution, c) analysis of the findings, and d) references.

While APA style is not required for the body of this assignment, solid academic writing is expected, and documentation of sources should be presented using APA formatting guidelines, which can be found in the APA Style Guide, located in the Student Success Center.   

This assignment uses a rubric. Review the rubric prior to beginning the assignment to become familiar with the expectations for successful completion.

You are not required to submit this assignment to LopesWrite.
